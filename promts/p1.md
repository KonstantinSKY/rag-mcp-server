# Task: Minimal MCP Server in Rust with Rocket

Create a minimal MCP server in Rust using the Rocket framework, with the following requirements:

- Accepts HTTP POST requests at the endpoint `/search` with a JSON object containing a `"query"` field (string).
- Prints the value of the `"query"` field to the CLI/console when a request is received.
- Returns the string `"ok"` as the response.

## Instructions

- Write each step clearly: project creation, adding dependencies, writing the code, running the server.
- All code and commands should be easy to copy and use directly.
- All comments and explanations should be brief and in English.
- Include a curl example for testing the server.
- Do not add extra features or boilerplate â€” only what is needed for this minimal example.

## Output Format

- Write everything in a direct, step-by-step manner, as in web coding or CLI mode.
- Use code blocks for commands and source code.
- Example:
  1. Open the terminal and run:

     ```bash
     cargo new mcp_server
     ```

  2. Open the file ... and replace its contents with:
     ```rust
     // code here
     ```
